Selenium is an umbrella project encapsulating a variety of tools and
libraries enabling web browser automation. Selenium specifically
provides infrastructure for the [W3C WebDriver specification](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webdriver/raw-file/tip/webdriver-spec.html)
â€” a platform and language-neutral coding interface compatible with all
major web browsers.

* [Selenium Java WebDriver](http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/)

* [Java 10 JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
